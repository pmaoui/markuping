# markuping
For viewing and paging through a markdown file with color and formatting

## Installation
`npm i -g markuping

## Usage
* `markuping README.md`

## Notes
I use this tool to display markup files with [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)
It is just a wrapper around [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) and [marked-terminal](https://github.com/mikaelbr/marked-terminal)
Feel free to customize anything
